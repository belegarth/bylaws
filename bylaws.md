    Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended from time
    to time, in such manner as the Board of Directors shall determine.

    determine, which are organized and operated exclusively for such
    purposes.

  - 11.5. The Officers may accept on behalf of BMCS any contribution,
    gift, bequest, or devise for the general purposes of or for any

    Officers and War Council records. A report of contributions received
    must be disclosed quarterly to War Council.
      - 11.5.1. The Officers may distribute, to an authorized person,
        any portion of a contribution, gift, bequest, or devise for the
        general purposes of or for any special purpose of BMCS not
        inconsistent with these Bylaws or as permitted by applicable
        law. Officers may require authorized persons to sign a notarized
        statement of conduct indicating that they understand
        contributions are distributed for local nonprofit activities
        only, and that they cannot be used for personal gain. BMCS
        Officers may also require all receipts from local activities
        supported by the distributed contributions as proof that
        activities are in accordance with our mission and the BMCS
        Articles of Incorporation. A report of contributions distributed

        supplemental to the annual budget and may be immediately used
        for a specific purpose of BMCS not inconsistent with its exempt
        purposes. The Officers of BMCS have the ability to accept and
        use earmarked funds without necessitating a WC vote to change
        the annual budget. Accepted donations that are distributed to
        authorized persons must follow the rules set forth in 11.5.2.
        BMCS Officers may refuse donations for any reason. Any accepted

    and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any proceeding,
    and including an action by or in the right of BMCS.

        otherwise determined by the Board in a specific instance,
        expenses incurred by an Indemnified Party in defending any
        "proceeding" may be advanced by BMCS before final
        disposition of the proceeding upon receipt by BMCS of a contract
        from the Indemnified Party to repay such amount unless it is

        be indemnified by the BMCS for those expenses.
      - 11.6.2. BMCS shall have power to purchase and maintain insurance
        to the full extent permitted by law on behalf of the Indemnified
        Parties, against any liability asserted against or incurred by
        such persons in such capacity or arising out of the person's
        status as such.
  - 11.7. BMCS shall keep correct and complete books of account and
    records and shall also keep Minutes of the proceedings of the

    period after officer elections. This annual budget will include a
    proposal for maintaining an online presence and executing BMCS
    official events.
      - 11.9.1. A voting Realm may motion to make an addition to the
        annual budget draft by proposing funding for an additional
        project or projects that are in accordance with our mission
        statement and Articles of Incorporation during the first voting
        period. Once a motion is seconded, BMCS Officers must make a
        statement of the proposals' feasibility within 48 hours. If
        the motion is passed by a 2/3 majority vote as defined in
        Article 10, then the additional project is to be included in the
        annual budget draft.
      - 11.9.2. After the first voting period, Officers of BMCS will
        finalize the annual budget draft, ensure that it is fiscally
        feasible, and examine that its implementation is in accordance
        with the BMCS mission statement and Articles of Incorporation.
        The BMCS Officers will present a completed annual budget to War
        Council one week before the first day of the second voting
        session (June 1st) along with a statement from the Treasurer
        endorsing the fiscal feasibility of the budget and a statement
        of endorsement from the President indicating how its
        implementation is in accordance with the BMCS nonprofit mission.
        As an exception to Article 10, a motion for voting on the annual
        budget may be accepted before June 1st to facilitate early
        voting. A voting Realm must motion to vote on the annual budget.
        A separate voting Realm must second that motion.
      - 11.9.3. The Annual budget must be passed by a 2/3 majority vote
        as defined in Article 10. Once the budget has been passed, it is
        implemented by BMCS Officers starting July 1st.
      - 11.9.4. If the annual budget is not passed by WC or if an
        emergency arises that requires expenditures outside of the
        annual budget, the President has the ability to call an
        emergency vote to pass a new budget. In the absence of a passed
        annual budget, Officers of BMCS may continue financial
        operations and implement items from the previous passed annual
        budget. Officers of BMCS may expend funds in an emergency as
        long as an emergency vote has been called. Any expenditures

          - 13.4.1.3 For any situation resulting in a ban of any sort,
            occurring at any level within the community including but

            the host issuing such punishment must submit to the BMCS

              - 13.4.1.3.3 The full discussion and conclusion shall be

## **Article 16: Directors**

  - 16.1. **General Powers and Standard of Care.** All organizational
    powers, and the business and affairs of BMCS shall be exercised by
    or under authority of the Board of Directors, except as may be
    otherwise provided herein. Any Director may also be, but need not
    be, an officer of BMCS.
      - 16.1.1. A Director shall perform such Director's duties as a
        Director would ordinarily perform, including such Director's
        duties as a member of any committee upon which such Director may
        serve, and shall perform all such duties in good faith, in a
        manner such Director reasonably believes to be in the best
        interests of BMCS, and with such care as an ordinarily prudent
        person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.
        In performing such Director's duties, a Director shall be
        entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports or
        statements, including financial statements and other financial
        data, in each case prepared or presented by: (a) One (1) or more
        officers or employees of the BMCS whom the Director reasonably
        believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
        (b) legal counsel, public accountants or other persons as to
        matters that the Director reasonably believes to be within such
        person's professional or expert competence; and (c) a
        committee of the Board upon which such Director does not serve,
        duly designated in accordance with a provision of these Bylaws,
        as to matters within its designated authority, which committee
        the Director reasonably believes to merit confidence. A person
        who performs such duties shall have no liability by reason of
        being or having been a Director of BMCS.
  - 16.2. **Number, Appointment and Qualifications of Directors.** The
    Board of Directors of BMCS shall be not less than three (3) persons
    and not more than ten (10) persons, each of whom shall serve for a
    term of one (1) to three (3) years. Said Director shall hold office
    for the term for which such Director is elected and until such
    Director's successor shall have been elected and qualified, and
    each Director may serve as many successive terms as such Director is
    elected to serve on the Board. Directors may be, but need not be,
    residents of the State of Idaho. The Directors may, in their sole
    discretion, elect or appoint more directors after the adoption of
    these Bylaws.
  - 16.3. **Removal of Directors.** Any director may be removed from
    office by a two-thirds (2/3) majority vote of the total directors
    then serving on the Board.
  - 16.4. **Vacancies**. Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors
    may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining
    Directors though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors. A
    Director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the
    unexpired term of such Director's predecessor in office. Any
    directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of
    Directors may be filled by the Board of Directors.
  - 16.5. **Directors and Committee Meetings.** Meetings of the Board of
    Directors, regular or special, or meetings of any committee
    designated thereby, may be held either within or outside the State
    of Idaho. Unless otherwise specified in this Section or in the
    notice for such meeting, all meetings shall be hosted from the
    principal office of the BMCS. Except as otherwise provided, regular
    or special meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee
    designated thereby may be called by or at the request of the
    President, any Director or chairman of a committee, as applicable,
    upon written or verbal notice thereof given to each Director and
    other committee members, if applicable, at least three (3) days
    before such meeting is set to occur. The Board of Directors may
    provide, by resolution, the time and place for the holding of
    regular meetings without other notice. The Board of Directors, or
    any committee designated thereby, may participate in a meeting of
    the Board or such committee by telephone conference, or similar
    electronic communications equipment by means of which all persons
    participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time,
    and the participation by such means shall constitute presence the
    same as being present in person at the meeting and shall not affect
    the validity of actions taken at said meeting.
      - 16.5.1. The attendance at or participation of a Director or
        committee member in any meeting shall constitute a waiver of
        notice of such meeting, except where a Director attends or
        participates for the express purpose of objecting to the
        transaction of any business because the meeting is not properly
        or lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be
        transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special
        meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated
        thereby, need be specified in the notice of waiver of notice of
        such meeting. Any Board action to remove a director or to
        approve a matter that would require approval by the members
        shall not be valid unless each director is given at least seven
        (7) days' written notice that the matter will be voted upon at
        a directors' meeting, or unless notice is waived.
  - 16.6. **Informal Action.** Any action required to be taken at a
    meeting of the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting if
    a consent in writing sets forth the action taken, which shall be
    signed by at least a majority of the Directors.
  - 16.7. **Quorum and Voting Requirements**. One-third (1/3) of the
    Directors, or a minimum of three (3) of the Board members
    represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at a
    Board meeting. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the
    majority of the board members represented at the meeting and
    entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the
    Board, unless the vote of a greater number required for a specific
    action is required by these Bylaws.
  - 16.8. **Proxies**. A Board member may vote either in person or by
    proxy executed in writing by the Board member. No proxy shall be
    valid after thirty (30) days from the date of its execution. Every
    proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the Director who
    executed said proxy.
  - 16.9. **Compensation**. The Directors shall determine whether
    elected members may be reasonably compensated and to what fair and
    reasonable extent. To be fair and reasonable, the Board must
    consider compensation structures for other persons in similarly
    situated nonprofit organizations with similar titles,
    responsibilities and expertise as each individual Director in the
    geographical region BMCS operates in, and of other organizations of
    similar size and means. All decisions regarding compensation for
    Directors of BMCS must be fair to the organization, and shall be
    made in accordance with BMCS's Conflicts of Interest Policy.
    However, reasonable expenses incurred may be reimbursed when
    expended for and in the interest of BMCS and its exempt purpose(s),
    and approved by the Board of Directors in advance. All Directors are
    responsible for reading and complying with the Conflict of Interest
    Policy adopted BMCS.
  - 16.10. **Loans to Directors.** The Organization shall not lend money
    to or use its credit to assist its Directors or officers, unless
    approved by all Directors in accordance with BMCS's Conflicts of
    Interest Policy.
  - 16.11. **Liability of Directors for Wrongful Distribution of
    Assets.** A Director shall not be liable under this Section 16 if,
    in the exercise of ordinary care, such Director relied and acted in
    good faith upon written financial statements of BMCS represented to
    such Director to be correct by the President or by any officer of
    BMCS having charge of its books of account, or certified by an
    independent licensed or certified public accountant or firm of such
    accountants fairly to reflect the financial condition of BMCS, nor
    shall such Director be so liable if, in the exercise of ordinary
    care and good faith, in determining the amount available for such
    distribution, such Director considered the assets to be of their
    book value. A Director against whom a claim shall be asserted under
    this section and who shall be held liable thereon shall be entitled
    to contribution from persons who accepted or received such
    distribution knowing such distribution to have been made in
    violation of this section in proportion to the amounts received by
    them respectively.
